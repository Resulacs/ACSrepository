I’m a software developer in progress, learning and building projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL.
I focus on turning ideas into real applications while improving my skills.
I’m also exploring crypto and blockchain, working on projects that combine coding with crypto technology.
My goal is to keep building, learning, and growing as a developer, one project at a time.
